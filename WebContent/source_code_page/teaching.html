            <p>
                  I have strong interest in teaching activities and always feel good 
				  showing my peers what I knew, so I determine to choose teaching to 
				  be my life-long career. From August 2008 to May 2011, I worked as 
				  a teaching assistant for a wide range of courses, including Database,
				  Geography Information System, Urban Geography, Word Cities, and 
				  American Geography. And later, in fall 2011, I became an independent
				  instructor of INF 202 Database Concept and Design in my college. 
				  I not only survived in the first teaching semester, the positive 
				  results also encouraged me to teach diverse courses. Currently, 
				  as an adjunct faculty in my department, I am teaching three courses,
				  two sections of INF 201 Web Technology and one section of INF 202 
				  Database. I believe the teaching experiences and academic backgrounds 
				  accumulated in the college would enhance my future teaching career 
				  and also evolve as a college faculty.
            </p>
            
            <p>
					First of all, I believe that teaching computer and information
					sciences in college is a necessity to prepare students inside
					and outside of the discipline for becoming competent generalists 
					who may then develop the deep specialties demanded in this 
					increasingly complex world. The majority of U.S. schools not only
					require that students can use computers but also expect students
					could use computer to explore millions of records using interactive
					tools to visualize and display data. The schools also prepare 
					students to innovate and create the new technologies that drive 
					local and national economies. Computer Science underlies most 
					innovation today, from biotechnology to cinematography to national 
					security. This ability to innovate with technology is also important
					for students' future success and ability to make a difference in a 
					global society. Computer and information knowledge is one of the 
					major elements of the necessary foundational knowledge of an educated
					person. Computer Science is also a very suitable field for teaching
					students to engage in complex thinking activities and develop
					reasoning skills from multiple perspectives, thus helping them 
					advance not only their specialized disciplinary abilities but also
					proving helpful in their everyday lives as well.

            </p>
            
       
	   
            
            <p>
               In addition, by teaching technical courses, I would like to guide students
			   to think of the problems they meet as challenges in real world such as an 
			   IT product or a website, because students can understand a problem 
			   thoroughly if they connect it with something they are familiar with. 
			   In summary, education in computer sciences goes far beyond telling students
			   where things are-rather; it is to help create generalists with specific 
			   specialty; it is to provide a powerful perspective for logical analysis 
			   and valuable skills; and it is also to enlarge the scope of thinking by 
			   adding considerations into everyday life.
			   </p>
            
            <p>
                
				In terms of teaching practice, I believe a good course should go beyond
				lecturing and discussion and that the intellectual level should be higher
				than just understanding and remembering. I understand the role of good 
				instructional design in successful teaching. When I plan to teach a 
				course, I will make sure I have clear objectives for students to achieve,
				know how to assess the extent to which those objectives are achieved, and
				choose relevant teaching activities consistent with both the objectives
				and assessment.
            </p>
            
            <p>
           Moreover, I am also a believer in the use of hands on exercises and diverse teaching 
		   methods in teaching. I like to get a variety of teaching methods, such as slide lectures,
		   group exercises, team based learning (TBL), online courses, in class exam, and 
		   take home exams. Different teaching styles stimulate the interests of students 
		   and facilitate good learning. I also lay emphasis on hands exercises in 
		   teaching because students will learn real knowledge when they are really doing
		   something. However, the exercises should be organized and presented in a way 
		   not to become overwhelming.
            </p>
            
            <p>I also like to bring my own research into the classroom when I think it is relevant
			and useful. This connection usually attracts positive attention from students
			and it is a good activity to teach students how to conduct academic research. 
			For example, my dissertation is General Transit Feed Specialization data 
			visualization and application, in which I need to build the database in MySQL
			and present data on web by HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Therefore, I presented 
			my research in both classes. In database class, I describe the process how 
			to build the GTFS database and how to retrieval data from database in a web 
			project; on the other hand, in Web Technology class, I present how to use div 
			tag build the web structure. It proved a very successful exchange with the 
			students.
                
				</p>
            
            <p>
                Finally, I believe fairness and caring about students are also necessary for success in teaching. I am glad when I hear
                students say I am doing well on these aspects of the relationship that develops between student and teacher.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Overall, it is always a great feeling when I can help students grow intellectually and mentally through my efforts; 
				and such a sense of achievement is very rewarding to me. Although it usually takes me 
				so much time to prepare for lectures, exercises, and other assignments, and have to 
				interact with students at the same time, interest, responsibility, and enthusiasm always
				encourage me to keep a good balance in the different aspects of life. 
				One of my strengths is that I am always looking for something new to learn
				and keep improving myself during the process, and I am confident this will
				sustain me through my teaching career.

            <h3>Instructor: INF 201 Web Technology & INF 202 Database</h3>
            
            <h4>Course Description:</h4>
            
            <p>
                Currently, I am teaching two sections of INF 201 Web Technology and one section of INF 202 Database 
				at State University of New York, Albany. Both are 3 credits undergraduate core courses in the Department of Informatics.
                All three courses are arranged in the same computer lab with 24 seats. All three courses are full enrolled 
				by either computer science undergraduate or information sciences undergraduate.
                Before this semester, I taught INF 201 in Spring 2013 and INF 202 in Fall 2011, Spring 2012 and Fall 2012. 
				In retrospect it was a great experience. I still remember, in 2011, how excited I was when some students told me
				they would not know it was my first time teaching if I had not told them. I always examine and generalize
				my teaching in the middle of semester and by the end of semester. Also, I always update my teaching contents in the following semester.
				For example, in INF 201 I add Google Maps API introduction this semester which was not covered last Spring; in INF 202, I start to use 
				MySQL as DBMS this semester. In the previous semester, Access was the major tool, which actually is not a complete database management system. 
				I am also trying different teaching methods. In the past five semester, my teaching methods include slides presentation, individual exercises,
				group exercises, team base learning and online courses.
				These teaching experiences gave me a good foothold from which I can continue to improve; but at the same 
				time, I also felt a sense of achievement as an instructor and I am determined to make college teaching as
				a major focus of my academic career. Below I list syllabus, midterm evaluations and final evaluations for my teaching.

            <p>
                After the course I sent e-mails to a random group of students to ask for their feedback about their learning and my teaching during the whole semester in order to
				obtain valuable information to benefit my future teaching. Most students found the materials in the course interesting and expressed they learned more when exercises were given during the class.
				I always insert some exercise during the class to help students digest what they just learned and regain their attention. 
				They also liked my generalization talk before class that usually helped them to review the knowledge in last class and realize the agenda of current class. Last semester, in 201 Web Technology, Some students felt my demo was a little fast and sometimes I tried to feed too much information
				in a limited time. Part of reason is that last spring was first time teaching for Web Technology. This is what I am working on - how to manage
				time and the pace of a new course.  I am positive it will 
				be better as my experience accumulates.  
		        In summary, looking for direct feedback from students has been a major element in my 
				instructional development. While I am glad to hear encouraging words about how my students learn well from the course, I also welcome critics from whom I can learn.

            <h3>Working as Teaching Assistant for Multiple Courses</h3>
            
            <p>
                From August 2008 to May 2011, I worked as a teaching assistant in Department of Informatics and Department of
				Geography and Planning at State University of New York, Albany. I helped in a wide range of undergraduate courses
				including <em>Database Concept and Design</em>, <em>Geography Information System</em>, <em>World Cities</em>, 
				<em>Urban Geography</em>, <em>American Cities</em>, <em>China Geography</em>. Thanks to the diversity of subjects, 
				I have learned from a variety of experienced professors rich subject knowledge, useful teaching skills, and how to
				interact with students effectively.
            </p>
            
            <p>My work usually included preparing course materials, grading homework and exams, answering student questions during
			office hours, leading database labs, and helping students with projects. Occasionally I gave lectures, usually because the 
			instructor missed the class for some reasons. I give a lecture regarding China Urban Planning and Development every fall semester in <em>World Cities</em>.  This TA experience has laid a solid foundation for me to become a college teacher. 
			During my first time teaching as an independent instructor, whenever I met some problems, I looked back to my TA experience for 
			potential solutions and most of the time I could find a good one. In retrospect, I really enjoyed my TA experience and have been
			grateful to those warm-hearted professors who helped me greatly in personal development.

                Currently, I am teaching this course and I am glad to continue to teach. As we all know, database is the basis for any IT product so it is a very important class. Because I have taught this class in four semester, I have 
				 solid lecture slides, 10 in ER model exercises, 10 physical database design exercises in Access and MySQL. Personally, I have a lot of experiences on database for web, especially spatial data.

            <p> I am also teaching this class now and I am glad to teach this class in the future. In this class, I cover HTML, CSS and JavaScript. There are 25 lectures and 24 exercises.
			Normally, I will assign an exercise right after my lecture so the students could digest my teaching and regain their attention. Web Technology class is a very important class.
			According to college census, 70% of aluminus from my college are working in a web-related position.  
               </p>
